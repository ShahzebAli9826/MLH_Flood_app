# FLUX: AI-Powered Multimodal Satellite Flood Detection & Autonomous Disaster Response System
</div>

<b>Flux is an autonomous conversational agent that bridges large language models with real time physical world infrastructure data. Powered by OpenAI GPT-4o and the MirEye Earth API, Flux handles open ended conversational tasks while dynamically routing location sensitive queries to verified spatial, hydrological and environmental hazard tools across the United States.
  
Emergency managers, field responders and residents often lack instant verified physical world context during extreme weather events, forcing them to manually consult disjointed federal GIS portals. By fusing dual encoder satellite Earth observation (SAR + Optical) with Mireye's sub meter physical intelligence layer, continuous Topographic Wetness Index hydrology, and an in flight human in the loop decision engine, Flux identifies imminent flash flood zones, dynamically routes evacuees away from submersed corridors, and empowers incident commanders in real time. Flux bridges conversational AI with real time geospatial ground telemetry i.e. users ask questions about any US city, county or landmark in plain English and Flux automatically resolves place names into coordinates, queries MirEye's sub meter Earth observation API and delivers actionable safety insights backed by authoritative federal citations (USGS, FEMA, NOAA).</b>

##  Executive Overview

During major flood disasters, emergency response operations suffer from two fatal blind spots:

1. The "Flat Map" Blind Spot: Standard satellite segmentation only tells you where surface water was when the satellite passed overhead. It cannot tell you ground elevation, soil saturation, building heights, population counts or which dry roads will submerge in the next 6 hours.
2. The "Naive Routing" Blind Spot: Evacuation navigation systems route evacuees based on shortest straight line distance, leading civilians directly into low elevation terrain depressions and flooded road basins.

Flux bridges this gap by injecting physical telemetry from the Mireye API (USGS 3DEP DEM elevation, slope, FEMA 100/500 yr floodplains, USGS NHD hydrography, and Overture building footprints) into every routing, triage, and dispatch decision.

 **Core Innovation: What Flux Solves**

## Empirical Validation: Does Mireye Context Matter?

To prove that the Mireye coordinate round-trip performs critical life-safety work rather than visual decoration, Flux runs an empirical benchmark comparing a **Naive Straight-Line Strategy** against the **Mireye Context-Aware Strategy** across 33 real disaster clusters.

[SUMMARY RESULTS] 
  - Total Evaluated Clusters    : 33
  - Diverged Recommendations    : 2 clusters (6.1%)
  - Avg Extra Distance Accepted : +1.15 km (Safety Detour)
  - Sensitivity Projection      : 9.1% (Widened TWI Variance)

Context aware routing altered the primary shelter recommendation in 6.1% of disaster clusters, accepting an average of +1.15 km of travel to steer evacuees away from high risk, flood compromised access corridors.

#### 4. Running on Mobile Phone using Expo Go 📱

To run the mobile app on an actual Android or iOS device using **Expo Go**:

1. **Connect to Same Wi-Fi:** Ensure your phone and development computer are connected to the **same local Wi-Fi network**.
2. **Find Local IP Address:**
   - **Windows:** Run `ipconfig` in CMD/PowerShell (look for IPv4 Address under Wireless LAN/Ethernet, e.g., `192.168.1.7`).
   - **macOS / Linux:** Run `ifconfig` or `ip a` (e.g., `192.168.1.7`).
3. **Configure API Endpoint:**
   - By default, `dell-flood-app/src/services/api.ts` targets `http://192.168.1.7:8000/api`.
   - If your IP is different, update `DEFAULT_API_URL` in `src/services/api.ts` or change it dynamically inside the **App Settings Panel** within the app UI.
4. **Start Expo LAN Server:**
   ```bash
   npx expo start --lan
   ```
5. **Open in Expo Go:**
   - **Android:** Open the **Expo Go** app, tap **Scan QR Code**, and scan the QR code printed in your terminal (or type `exp://<YOUR_LOCAL_IP>:8081`).
   - **iOS:** Open the default **Camera App**, scan the QR code, and open in Expo Go.

---

#### 5. Building Standalone Android APK (EAS Build)

To build a standalone installable `.apk` file for Android:

1. Install EAS CLI (if not installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g eas-cli
   ```
2. Run EAS Preview Build:
   ```bash
   npx eas-cli build --platform android --profile preview
   ```
3. Once completed on Expo Cloud, download and install the resulting `.apk` file directly on any Android phone.

---

### 🛡️ Environment & Git Security Configuration
- `.env` files contain sensitive API credentials and are automatically ignored via `.gitignore`.
- Reference templates are provided in `.env.example` in both root and `dell-flood-backend/`.
- Heavy ML weights (`*.pth`, `*.onnx`) and build artifacts (`node_modules/`, `dist/`, `.expo/`) are excluded from Git history.

## Tactical Disaster Map Visualizations

Flux renders **100% watermark-free, high-contrast Folium HTML maps** built for emergency management operations. Every map includes an interactive Disaster HUD legend and multi-layer toggles:

*  **Active Inundation Footprint:** High contrast danger polygon extracted via dual encoder SAR/Optical satellite imagery.
*  **Critical Runoff Nodes:** Glowing magenta markers identifying concave terrain basins with high TWI scores prone to flash pooling.
*  **Affected Neighborhood Centroids:** High contrast targets displaying population estimates and building counts from DBSCAN clustering.
*  **Safe Emergency Shelters:** Emerald pins indicating safe facilities tagged with ground DEM elevation.
*  **Elevation-Weighted Evacuation Paths:** Cyan polyline corridors steering clear of flood prone road segments.

> Maps are automatically generated . Open any map directly in a web browser to inspect interactive popups with DEM heights, slope angles, FEMA status, and soil drainage properties.

## Honest Caveats & Open Items

In the interest of full technical integrity and transparency:
1. **DEM Smoothing Resolution:** In synthetic raster tests, continuous DEM smoothing compressed TWI scores into a narrow band (mean 6.8–7.3). When evaluated against real point level ground truth in `physical_data.json`, TWI scores showed realistic variance ranging from 7.16 to 12.89.
2. **Road-Risk Field Status:** Road risk scores currently use a synthetic topographic hazard proxy until Mireye's native road exposure attributes are enabled.
3. **Shelter Verification:** Athens County, Ohio utilizes verified, real world community shelters (Athens Community Center & Athens High School), other regions utilize geographically distributed benchmark facilities that should be verified with local emergency management agencies prior to deployment.
